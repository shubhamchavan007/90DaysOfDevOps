Hi My Name Is Shubham Chavan,

What Defines my Learning plan is: 

 My Understanding about DevOps & Cloud Engineering:
 
 -For Me Personally As a biased IT Guy, System Administration was a One Thing At My Bachelor Years where i use to work as lab-assistant ,but when i was introduced to firewalls and server related stuff i got to know about  how the whole system works around & how a system-administrator has a lot of responsibilities of the whole college. Later On , I Started My Learning Through AWS Cloud On Youtube & then Recognizing what DevOps &Cloud Engineering Fulfills the responsibilities that No One Can Do IS My Thing That I LOVE A Lot To DO.
 
 -My Ultimate Goal Is To Become DevOps Engineer With (The Highest Package The Industry Has To Offer)
